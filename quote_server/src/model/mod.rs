//! Domain models and utilities for the quote server.

//! This module groups all core data types and helpers used by the UDP receiver,
//! streaming tasks, and the background quote generator:
//! - `quote` — market `Quote` type and (de)serialization helpers.
//! - `tickers` — supported ticker symbols used across the system.
//! - `ping_monitor` — in-memory keep-alive tracker for client timeouts.
//! - `quote_generator` — background data generator and `QuoteEvent` broadcasting.
