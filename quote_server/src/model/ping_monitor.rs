//! Ping/keep-alive state tracker for UDP clients.
//!
//! This module provides a lightweight, in-memory monitor that tracks the last time a
//! client (identified by `SocketAddr`) sent a keep-alive/ping. It exposes three core
//! operations:
//!
//! - `PingMonitor::update_ping(addr)` — record a fresh ping for a client and mark it active.
//! - `PingMonitor::check_timeouts()` — scan all clients and return the addresses that have
//!   exceeded the configured timeout; those clients are marked inactive internally.
//! - `PingMonitor::is_client_active(addr)` — read-only check whether a client is currently
//!   considered active.
//!
//! Design notes:
//! - Time is measured using `std::time::Instant`, which is monotonic and immune to system
//!   clock changes.
//! - The monitor is not synchronized; if it is shared across threads, wrap it with a
//!   synchronization primitive (e.g., `Mutex` or `RwLock`).
//! - `check_timeouts` is idempotent between pings: once a client times out, it stays
//!   inactive until the next `update_ping` marks it active again.
